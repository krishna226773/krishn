Cyclic Sort:

When given numbers from range 1 to N Use Cycli sort

In 1 to N range the value is equal to value-1 index position of the array.
In 0 to N range the value is equal to value index position of the array.

String pool is memory that is placed in heap memory(Why String pool? memory optimization).

String immutability, because of immutability security is increased.(Example: four persons having same name if one person changes his name and for the rest the names do not change).

== checks values and both reference variables pointing to same value.

.equals method checks only value is equal or not.

If you want print object the object will convert toString and print it.

StringBuilder class will not create object if you modify that object.
